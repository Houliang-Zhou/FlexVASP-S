# FlexVASP-S
A preliminary implementation of FlexVASP-S as a flexible steric-aware 3D geometric framework for explaining protein binding specificity.

This is the first interpretable 3D geometic learning framework that identifies regions of hindrance in binding cavities that select for different ligands.  FlexVASP-S identifies these regions despite noisy conformational variations by using flexible structural representations and explainable AI techniques.
